<h1 align="center">Lab №2</h1> <h4 align="center">Advanced landing</h4>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Improve a landing page following the given design (same as 
previous) by adding full responsiveness and some animation.</p> 

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<p>1)The website should be partly responsive: 
Required: for 320px (iPhone 5s)  2560px (4K screens). 
Hint: for extra-large screen width, you can just fit website content 
inside a previously set container for the regular screen width and 
centre it horizontally.<br>
2)The header should collapse to a hamburger on small screens<br>
3)The website must contain animations (at least 3). Can be made in 
any possible way, preferably with css properties 
(animation/transition).<br>
4)Your project should be logically structured (all your CSS can’t be in 
just one-two files)<br>
5)All of the previous work requirements must be kept.</p>

<h2>Installation:</h2>
<p>You could just download the project and open index.html file and you are all set!</p>
